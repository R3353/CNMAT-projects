It's always changing in unexpected ways, and that's why I am saying, wow to how well this interpolates.  The tri~ \"bass\" is a layer that requires study by itself.  It contributes so much and can be listened to with interest all by itself, but you wouldn't know it's there in the context of the whole.  It's Amp Modulation interpolating the modulator higher and higher.  And as the modulator freq interps to multiples of the carrier, you get closer to the harmonic series, but creating super beatings as you are close but not quite.  It absolutely helps create this mysterious squinting i'm talking about.  It always has more to give even though we might not be aware it is there in the whole scene!  Then this downsampling & bitcrushing interp idea is extremely powerful and the power of it is vividly demonstrated in this composition,  The technique is in service of the music.
